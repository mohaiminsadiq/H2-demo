<h1> Genetic Algorithm </h1>

<p> 
    In order to find bias in a ML model via burden on a specific class of population, we need to find “counterfactual” corresponding to each data point in the dataset.
</p><p>
    Counterfactual is the point that is closest to the original point, but results in the opposite classification by the ML model.
</p><p>
    Thus we can see the counterfactual as a measure, of how far one individual is from getting the opposite decision in the ML model, 
    and burden is the average of this distance between each individual and counterfactual, within some subset of the entire population
     (e.g. with a specific skin color, or a specific race). This is why the word "burden" is used, as it shows the burden on people with a specific attribute.
</p><p>
    We find counterfactuals using a genetic algorithm, which is demonstrated below. The genetic algorithm involves randomly generating points within the sample
    space, then randomly mutating some population, randomly crossoverring some features between some population, and filtering the candidates with better fitness
    (i.e. closer distance from the original individual). These steps are repeated over generations, to find the optimal counterfactual.

    The above figure shows the evolution of the genetic algorithm, in finding the counterfactual (purple) for the individual (black square).
    The fitness value is the inverse of distance, thus it means how close two points are. The best fitness is the closeness of individual and 
    current best counterfactual at that generation.
</p><p>
    It can be seen that the counterfactual gradually moves toward the closest possible point across the class boundary from the individual,
    as generation goes forward.
    In this case, the maximum fitness reaches 17.53 at generation 55.

<p> 
    The above plot figure shows the evolution of the genetic algorithm in finding the counterfactual in the COMPAS dataset. Among many features, 
    it is showing only 3 features to project in 3D space. The black point is the original individual, and the light blue point is the closest 
    counterfactual. The red points are the ones that result in same classification, so cannot be the counterfactual. The blue points are the 
    candidates with top 50% fitness (i.e. closeness), and the green points are bottom 50% candidates for the counterfactual.
</p><p>
    Since the ML model is much more complicated than the above case, the class boundary is harder to see compared to the above figure, but 
    the red points (i.e. Non-counterfactuals) are somewhat separeted from candidates for the counterfactual that the algorithm is finding.
</p><p>
    It can be seen that the counterfactual gradually moves toward the original individual, as generations goes forward. 
    In this case, the maximum fitness reaches 0.46 at generation 10.
